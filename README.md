# HR Data Analysis Project

This project delves into the realm of human resource data analysis, leveraging SQL queries and Power BI visualization to unearth vital insights that can empower HR professionals and organizational decision-makers. The analysis encompasses various facets of HR management, including employee demographics, turnover rates, tenure distribution, departmental performance, and geographical distribution, among others. This project aims to provide actionable intelligence for strategic workforce planning and organizational optimization by harnessing the power of data-driven insights.

## Overview

The HR_Data_Analysis project explores a dataset containing 22,000 records from 2000 to 2020, encompassing employee information such as age, gender, job title, department, location, race, hire date, and termination date. The dataset is analyzed using SQL scripts to extract meaningful insights, which are then visualized and presented in interactive dashboards using Power BI.

## SQL Analysis

The SQL scripts perform various data analysis tasks, including age distribution, gender breakdown, departmental turnover rates, tenure distribution, geographical distribution, and more. These scripts are designed to extract actionable insights from the raw data, providing valuable information for HR decision-making.

## Power BI Visualization

The Power BI report visualizes the insights generated from the SQL analysis, offering interactive dashboards that facilitate easy interpretation and exploration of HR metrics. The report includes various visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, line charts, and tables, allowing users to drill down into specific aspects of HR data and gain deeper insights.
